title: ## Welcome to my website
---

I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the UC Merced [soil physics lab](http://soilphysics.ucmerced.edu/). My research interests are in applying machine learning and spatial analysis to address environmental problems across scales. I have a particular interest in remote sensing surface-subsurface processes from unmanned aircraft systems.

You can check out some of the projects I work on at my [GitHub page](https://github.com/saraya209).

## Tools I use
I primarily code in _R_ and less so in _Python_. Software and computational tools I work with include _ArcGIS/QGIS_, _Google Earth Engine API_ (JavaScript), _Shiny development_, _Git_, and high-performance computing.
