title: ## Welcome to my website
---

I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the UC Merced [soil physics lab](http://soilphysics.ucmerced.edu/). My research interests are in applying machine learning and spatial analysis to address environmental problems across scales. I have a particular interest in remote sensing surface-subsurface processes from unmanned aircraft systems.

I primarily code in R and less so in Python. Software and computational tools I've worked with include ArcGIS/QGIS, Google Earth Engine API (JavaScript), Shiny development, Git, and high-performance computing.
