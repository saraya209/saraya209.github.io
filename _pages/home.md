title: ## Welcome to my website
---

I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the UC Merced [soil physics lab](http://soilphysics.ucmerced.edu/). I am interested in applying machine learning and spatial analysis to address environmental problems across scales. My doctoral research is on linking soil structure and land surface characteristics with soil hydrology by using machine learning, unmanned aircraft systems, and observations from long-term conservation agriculture management.

I primarily code in R and less so in Python. Software and computational tools I've worked with include ArcGIS/QGIS, Google Earth Engine API (JavaScript), Shiny development, Git, and high-performance computing.
