title: ## Welcome to my website
---

I'm a postdoctoral research fellow at Stanford University [Soil and Environmental Biogeochemistry group](https://pangea.stanford.edu/soils/). My research interests are in applying  machine learning and spatial analysis methods to address soil and environmental problems across scales.

My research is focused on using data science methods to understand subsurface soil biogeochemistry. I am currently involved in research focused on deciphering arsenic concentrations on rice using unmanned aircraft systems based remote sensing. I am also working on an effort to determine the links between surface characteristics and subsurface biogeochemistry in a floodplain environment.

My recent doctoral dissertation at the UC Merced [Soil Physics group](http://soilphysics.ucmerced.edu/) was on linking soil structure and land surface characteristics with soil hydrology by using machine learning, unmanned aircraft systems, and observations from long-term conservation agriculture management.

I primarily code in R and a little in Python. My computational proficiencies include ArcGIS, QGIS, Google Earth Engine API (JavaScript), Shiny development, Git, and high-performance computing.
